#Demon 1.0
###Codeigniter Application For Network Security Monitoring
by [LiHaibo_ISLee](http://lihaibo.sinaapp.com)

Demon is derived from [snorby](http://www.snorby.org).
I had planned to rewrite Snorby in PHP.Later I decided to add some functions to it.
So I copied some functions from Snorby, added some new functions and renamed it to Demon.
The newly added functions includes GeoIP and so on.Still it's lightweight, simple, and clean.

##Installation
Just copy the files from this package to your web directory.For example, copy demon to /var/www.
Then set the follow configurations located in application\config\database.php
$db['default']['hostname'] = '192.168.116.131';
$db['default']['username'] = 'snort';
$db['default']['password'] = 'snort';
$db['default']['database'] = 'suricata';

##Usage
Visit your website.

##Default Login
Username: admin
Password: admin

##More
I am a newbie web developer.
And I have just finished a very small part of the whole work.
I will be appreciated if you contribute to this project.
